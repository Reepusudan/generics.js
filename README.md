# A minimal deep learning library for the web
generics.js

The library allows to leverage to create and deploy real time deep learning solution currently including ANN and CNN with fully featured reinforcement learning and k-fold cross validation tests.

## API Docs :
www.trygistify.com/generics

## Real time examples:
Food rating prediction: 
Dogs and cats prediction: 

## Installation:
`npm install generics.js —save`

## Features  :
1) K fold cross validation tests  (used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample) :  
2) Saving and retrieving of model  :  

## What’s next ?
*We will need to implement shared memory* between nan and *.cu * so the GPUs access will become faster
